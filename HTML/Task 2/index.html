    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Introduction to Java</h1>
    <p>Java is a <strong>high-level, object-oriented programming language</strong> developed by <em>Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle)</em>. <br/> 
It was designed to be platform-independent, allowing programs to run on any device with a <strong><q>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</q></strong>.  <br/>
Java follows the <ins>Write Once, Run Anywhere</ins> (WORA) principle, making it highly portable.  <br/>
It supports features like <cite>encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism</cite>, which are core to object-oriented programming.  <br/>
Java is widely used in web development, mobile applications <del>(especially Android)</del>, and enterprise <software class="br"></software>
Learning Java is also important like learning Math like (a+b)<sup>2</sup> and Chemistry like H<sub>2</sub>O.  <br/>
Its syntax is similar to <mark>C and C++</mark>, but with simplified memory management and fewer low-level facilities.  <br/>
<pre>
    <code>
        class Sample{
            public static void main(String[] args){
                System.out.println("Hello World");
            }
        }
    </code>
    <samp>Output : Hello World</samp>
</pre><br>
Java includes a rich standard library that provides utilities for data structures, networking, multithreading, and more.  <br/>
It features automatic garbage collection, which helps manage memory efficiently and reduces the risk of memory leaks.  <br/>
Java follows <abbr title="Universal Code">UNICODE</abbr> to perform operations. <br/>
The language emphasizes security, robustness, and performance, making it suitable for <small>large-scale</small> applications. <br/> 
Due to its versatility and strong community support, Java remains one of the <big>most popular programming languages worldwide</big>.</p><br/>
